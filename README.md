Concerns:
1. Navigate away from task edit form if no errors
2. Change frontend routes for teams and projects to be like users/2/projects/1 with conditional rendering so if you go to that route and its not your project, you get an unauthorized message

Vue has a watcher to see if user_id or other attr change to fetch that for the new user
