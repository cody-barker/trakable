Concerns:
1. Navigate away from task edit form if no errors
2. Consider allowing team members to view other users task details page and/or projects associated with that team
3. Change frontend routes for teams and projects to be like users/2/projects/1 with conditional rendering so if you go to that route and its not your project, you get an unauthorized message
